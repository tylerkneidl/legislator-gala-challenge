Here is my submission for the take home test.  It's a little brutal in some areas 
but, I think it should be understandable.  I got hung up a few places, so just 
took a brute force approach where necessary.  

**To build** 
- you need npm already installed.
- `npm install`

**To run the main file**
- main.ts will output a json file called output.json to your home directory. 
- you can add your data manually to main.ts on line 67. If not, data is preseeded already. 
- to run main
 - `npm run main`

**To run the test scenarios**
- This isn't fully exhaustive and I wanted to get to actual unit testing with Jest but 
I think I was already pushing a reasonable amount of time.  Either way, I came up with 
a few edge cases for you to play with.  Feel free to break it if you have edge cases
I didn't think of.  I'd love to see it.
- test scenarios output to a folder called testOutputs in the home directory
- to run tests
 - `npm run tests`
