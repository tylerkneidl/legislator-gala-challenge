  "description": "- The Annual Legislator's Gala is here, it's the one night where members of congress all gather in one ballroom in DC, and discuss the results of the legislative session that had just passed. The event planners are as nervous as they are excited, knowing that they need to boil the seating chart down to a science because if the wrong pair are seated at the same table, tempers will flare. Additionally, some members of congress want to have constructive conversations about how the past year went, so the planners want to create a memorable night by seating them at the same table - So, you are tapped on the shoulder to build a system where given a list of legislators, a number of tables, and an optional param for preferred/avoided seating from the planner, it produces a seating chart for that night.",
